          Whereâ€™s The Food Trucks? A full-stack, mobile-first, single page
          application developed using React, Express, and MongoDB. I took the
          role of front-end developer in our team of three, designing and
          crafting most of our React components. The project is hosted through
          firebase, and available here:
          <span>
            {" "}
            <a href="https://wtf-truck.web.app/">Where's The Food Trucks?</a>
          </span>
          <p>
            NOTE: The app is currently down, but I am working to resolve this
            issue. In the meantime, here is a video of the app in action, taken
            by one of my team members.
